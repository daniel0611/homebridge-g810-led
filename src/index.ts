/*
 * IMPORTANT NOTICE
 *
 * One thing you need to take care of is, that you never ever ever import anything directly from the "homebridge" module 
 * (or the "hap-nodejs" module).
 * The above import block may seem like, that we do exactly that, but actually those imports are only used for types and interfaces
 * and will disappear once the code is compiled to Javascript.
 * In fact you can check that by running `npm run build` and opening the compiled Javascript file in the `dist` folder.
 * You will notice that the file does not contain a `... = require("homebridge");` statement anywhere in the code.
 *
 * The contents of the above import statement MUST ONLY be used for type annotation or accessing things like CONST ENUMS,
 * which is a special case as they get replaced by the actual value and do not remain as a reference in the compiled code.
 * Meaning normal enums are bad, const enums can be used.
 *
 * You MUST NOT import anything else which remains as a reference in the code, as this will result in
 * a `... = require("homebridge");` to be compiled into the final Javascript code.
 * This typically leads to unexpected behavior at runtime, as in many cases it won't be able to find the module
 * or will import another instance of homebridge causing collisions.
 *
 * To mitigate this the {@link API | Homebridge API} exposes the whole suite of HAP-NodeJS inside the `hap` property
 * of the api object, which can be acquired for example in the initializer function. This reference can be stored
 * like this for example and used to access all exported variables and classes from HAP-NodeJS.
